        <p>
            During the 2025 academic year, as part of the professional degree in video game, we carried out a second supervised project in the second semester on the theme: “In the shoes of an ice floe.” That's how I discovered
            the “Water” plugin for Unreal Engine 5 and how to manage the buoyancy of different actors, in other words, their ability to float.
