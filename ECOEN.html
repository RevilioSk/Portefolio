        <p>At the end of our professional degree in video game, while searching for internships, our class was working on free projects. My group focused
            on the theme of underwater ecology, which is a topic close to our hearts. This project was temporarily put on hold due to our various internships, but the goal is to
            continue it in the future. For my part, I worked on the different particles that form boids of fish and animal behavior.
